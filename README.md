# Srocero Health Claim Fact Checking Task

This repo contains the code and presentation required for the Sorcero task. 

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required libraries.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Note about architecture

The codes are aligned in such a way that all util functions have been divided into: 
- Visualization functions
- Process functions
- Model utils

The notebook imports from these for all the functions defined in the classes.
